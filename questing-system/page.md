#### **Opening the Quest Menu**

Use:

```
/quests
```

This opens the full UI, displaying:

* Active quests
* Completed quests
* Categories
* Rewards
* Progress bars

#### **Tracking Progress**

* Each quest shows a real-time progress bar.
* Hover interactions show objective details.
* Completed quests move to the “Completed” tab automatically.

#### **Completing a Quest**

Once all objectives are finished:

* Rewards are automatically added to your inventory or profile.
* Follow-up quests may unlock.
* Your Rank XP increases if the quest gives rank bonuses.

#### **Tips for Faster Progress**

* Complete Daily quests first — they give fast money and XP.
* Use Exploration quests to discover new resource zones.
* Stack compatible quests (ex: mining quests + crafting quests).
* Check back often for new questlines during events.
