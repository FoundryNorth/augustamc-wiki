# 🛍️ What Is A Player Shop?

## 📍 **Player Warps (/pw)**&#x20;

**Player Warps** are a system that lets players create public or private teleport locations that others can visit. They act like small player-made “warp points” for shops, farms, towns, museums, utilities, and anything players want to share.

The command players use is:

```
/pw
```

Hover over a playerhead to see the information, and left click to go to that player shop!

## ⭐ **How to Create a Player Warp**

Players stand at the location where they want their warp to be.

Then they run:

```
/pw create <warpname>
```

## ⭐ **Customizing a Player Warp**

After creating a warp, players can modify it using the GUI or commands.

#### Players can edit:

* **Warp Name**
* **Warp Icon** (item shown in the GUI)
* **Warp Description**
* **Warp Category** (Shops, Farms, Towns, etc.)
* **Public / Private status**
* **Teleport Fee** (if your server allows fees)
* **Warp Location** (can be moved/updated)

#### Delete example:

```
/pw delete <warpname>
```
