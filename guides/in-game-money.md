# In-Game Money

In-game money is used to claim land, trade with other players, move up the in-game ranks, and more. Luckily, players can choose from hundreds of different ways to earn money. This allows players to enjoy their time on Augusta Towny playing however they enjoy most.

## Custom Jobs

* **`/jobs`** to view all 12 custom in-game jobs. Players are in all jobs by default.
* Some helpful commands are **`/jobs stats`** **`/jobs info`**
* Players are incentivized to earn money for doing their jobs while selling the items they produce to players who enjoy other jobs or to the server store.
* Jobs are continually rebalanced to allow players to enjoy the game however they enjoy most.
* There are 100s of different ways items and money flow on Augusta Towny. Experiment with different stuff and see what is most fun for you!

• Sell items in the auction house using **`/ah sell [price] [amount]`** while holding what you want to sell.
