THIS PAGE IS OUT OF DATE

Build checks are currently not in effect
{% endhint %}

##

## **General Information**&#x20;

Build checks occur **Every Friday**&#x20;

Town owners with town issues will be pinged on discord These issues include, but are not limited to:

> 1. Insufficient Towny Funds
> 2. Building/Terrain violating eye-sore policy
>
> ⠀⠀↪ This now includes below-ground!
>
> 3. Your town does not meet the minimum member requirement
>
> ⠀⠀↪ You must have 3+ members in addition to the \
> ⠀⠀↪ Alt accounts do not count towards this

Each town is given 1 free pass each month to skip a check.&#x20;

↪ You may use this whenever but you MUST notify staff ASAP. If it is found you are abusing this feature, your town will no longer have access to this feature and you will receive staff punishment

**Effort displayed**&#x20;

↪This means I want to see that you are trying. I understand that everybody is not great at building. As long as it resembles a "town" or the start of one, that's fine!&#x20;

You are no longer safe underground&#x20;

↪This includes basements/underground farms. They must look nice!&#x20;

**No eye sores**&#x20;

↪This means..what it sounds like. No dirt shacks, no wooden shacks.. Make sure your terrain makes sense. We really don't like platforms/mob farms. You can create them, but challenge yourself by integrating them into your town builds.&#x20;

**Accountability**&#x20;

↪ Being a Town Owner comes with responsibility. If you notice a member is building an eye-sore, it is your responsibility to fix and enforce our building rules. There will be no "well so-so built it, that's not my fault!".



Town **deletion** within the Towny Plugin includes

* Loss of Town.
  * All Terrain and Items were revert to the natural world gen.
    * This means your builds, chests, items, everything not natural to the world gen will be <mark style="color:red;">**DELETED.**</mark>

As a reminder - your town will be set as "pending" until the next build check.&#x20;

Nobody is risking IMMEDIATE deletion. If your town does not qualify for approved for the second time, your town **WILL** be deleted at the next check. Final warnings will be sent a day before.
