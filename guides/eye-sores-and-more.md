# Eye-Sores & More

### Introduction

Welcome to Augusta Towny, where we strive to maintain a beautiful and harmonious environment for all players. The Eye-Sore Rule and Guidelines have been established to ensure that our town's landscapes remain visually appealing and enjoyable for everyone.

### Eye-Sore Rule

The Eye-Sore Rule is in place to prevent the creation of structures or elements within the server that may be considered visually disruptive, unappealing, or inappropriate. This rule helps maintain a high standard of aesthetics across Augusta Towny.

## How To Avoid Building An Eye-sore

1. **Make It Match:** Build things that aren't hard to look at.  We want everything to go together and make sense.
   1. Consider gravity into your builds.&#x20;
      1. How is that platform up there?&#x20;
         1. Is your island floating? Make it have clouds carrying it for example.
      2. Want to build a sky mob farm?&#x20;
         1. Turn it into a hot air balloon!&#x20;
   2. Block Palette
      1. Some blocks just dont go well together.&#x20;
         1. Carefully pick and plan the blocks that you want to use!
            1. [Block Palettes](https://www.blockpalettes.com/) is an excellent resource to figure out what to build with.
2. **Multi-purpose:** A build can be both good-looking and have money/quest purpose. For example, this storage room is within a large clock tower that adds to the towns aesthetic appeal

3. **Landscaping:** Making sure your builds are well incorporated into your landscape is crucial to avoiding eye-sores. Thoughtful use of terrain, plants, and outdoor features contributes to a well-rounded build.
   1. This also includes making sure you don't have mysterious floating platforms with no supports, or building on water with no anchors! 🛥️

4. Note on Farms:
   1. [Please note - Large farms/mob farms are not excused from the eye-sore rule. It is possible and expected that you disguise or multi-purpose farms.](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]
   2. We encourage large scale mob farms/crop farms, however it is expected that they abide to the eye-sore rule. Think of them as an extension of your town.  Blend functionality with aesthetics.&#x20;
      1. You can do this by
         1. Staircase to an underground farm instead of a hole.
            1. Instead of a simple hole, create a well-designed staircase leading to your underground farm.&#x20;
         2. Neat Walls
            1. Ensure the walls of your underground farms are well-organized. Avoid unfinished stone walls or chaotic/cluttered appearances.
         3. Thoughtful Lighting
            1. Incorporate lighting into the build&#x20;
               1. Don't do rows of floating lights, for example. Attach them to the ceiling instead!
